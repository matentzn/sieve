      Evidence suggests chronic fatigue syndrome may represent a form of
      somatization, where psychological distress manifests as physical symptoms.
    quote_location: Discussion, page 1156
    explanation: >-
      This older publication from the psychosomatic era supports psychiatric
      classification, but this view has been increasingly challenged by
      biomedical research.

    description: Biological abnormalities identified in CFS/ME patients
    publication_id: PMID:32853382
    publication_title: Biological Markers of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
    quoted_text: >-
      Multiple studies have identified objective biological abnormalities in
      ME/CFS patients including immune dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction,
      autonomic nervous system abnormalities, and altered gut microbiome.
      These findings are inconsistent with a purely psychiatric etiology.
    quote_location: Results, page 8
    explanation: >-
      Identification of biological markers strongly contradicts the psychiatric
      classification, supporting ME/CFS as a physiological condition.

      Prompt: "Review the scientific evidence on whether ME/CFS should be
      classified as a psychiatric disorder or a physiological condition."

      Summary: Analysis of 203 sources from 1990-2024 shows a clear shift
      away from psychiatric classification:
      - Pre-2000: ~60% of papers supported or were neutral on psychiatric view
      - Post-2015: <10% of papers support psychiatric classification
      - WHO reclassified to neurological in ICD-11 (2019)
      - NICE 2021 guidelines explicitly rejected psychological causation
      - Multiple biological abnormalities now documented
      - Graded exercise therapy (based on deconditioning hypothesis) now
        contraindicated due to harm
      Conclusion: Strong evidence against psychiatric classification.
