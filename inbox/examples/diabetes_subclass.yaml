    publication_title: Classification of Diabetes as an Endocrine Disorder
    quoted_text: >-
      Diabetes mellitus represents a heterogeneous group of metabolic
      disorders fundamentally rooted in endocrine dysfunction, specifically
      involving the pancreatic islet cells and their insulin-producing capacity.
    quote_location: Results, Section 3.2, paragraph 1
    explanation: >-
      The text explicitly states that diabetes is rooted in endocrine dysfunction
      involving pancreatic islet cells, directly supporting its classification
      as an endocrine system disorder.

    description: Some argue diabetes is primarily a metabolic disorder
    publication_id: PMID:29876543
    publication_title: Rethinking Diabetes Classification - A Metabolic Perspective
    quoted_text: >-
      While traditionally classified under endocrine disorders, diabetes mellitus
      is fundamentally a disorder of glucose metabolism. The focus on insulin
      secretion overlooks the broader metabolic dysregulation that defines the disease.
    quote_location: Discussion, page 412
    explanation: >-
      This text argues that diabetes should be classified as a metabolic disorder
      rather than an endocrine disorder, challenging the traditional classification.
