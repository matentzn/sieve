    description: ACR historically classified fibromyalgia with rheumatic conditions
    publication_id: PMID:2306288
    publication_title: The American College of Rheumatology 1990 Criteria for Fibromyalgia
    quoted_text: >-
      Fibromyalgia is classified as a rheumatic condition based on its presentation
      with widespread musculoskeletal pain and tenderness at specific anatomical sites.
    quote_location: Methods, page 160
    explanation: >-
      Historical classification by ACR placed fibromyalgia among rheumatic conditions,
      though this was based on symptom presentation rather than pathophysiology.

    publication_id: PMID:28389214
    publication_title: Central Sensitization in Fibromyalgia - A Neurological Perspective
    quoted_text: >-
      Evidence increasingly suggests that fibromyalgia is characterized by
      central sensitization and altered pain processing in the central nervous
      system. However, the exact classification remains debated, with some
      advocating for neurological and others for rheumatic categorization.
    quote_location: Discussion, page 892
    explanation: >-
      This text indicates uncertainty about the classification, noting evidence
      for neurological mechanisms while acknowledging the ongoing debate.
