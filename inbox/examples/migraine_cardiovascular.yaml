    publication_title: The Vascular Theory of Migraine - A Historical Perspective
    quoted_text: >-
      The vascular theory of migraine, which dominated for decades, proposed that
      migraine attacks were primarily caused by vasodilation of cranial blood vessels,
      suggesting a cardiovascular component to the disorder.
    quote_location: Introduction, page 2
    explanation: >-
      This older text supports the vascular/cardiovascular classification of migraine
      based on the historical vascular theory, though this theory has been largely superseded.

    publication_id: PMID:31578890
    publication_title: Migraine as a Primary Brain Disorder
    quoted_text: >-
      Current evidence overwhelmingly supports migraine as a complex neurological
      disorder originating in the central nervous system. The trigeminal-vascular
      system activation is secondary to cortical and brainstem dysfunction, not
      a primary cardiovascular event.
    quote_location: Abstract
    explanation: >-
      Modern research strongly contradicts the cardiovascular classification,
      establishing migraine as a primary neurological disorder.

      Prompt: "Review the scientific literature on migraine pathophysiology and
      determine whether migraine should be classified as a cardiovascular or
      neurological disorder."

      Summary: Analysis of 82 peer-reviewed sources from 2010-2024 reveals strong
      consensus that migraine is a primary neurological disorder. The vascular
      theory has been largely abandoned in favor of the neurovascular hypothesis,
      which places the primary dysfunction in the central nervous system. Only 3
      of 82 sources supported any cardiovascular classification.
