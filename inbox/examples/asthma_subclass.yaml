      Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway
      inflammation. It is defined by the history of respiratory symptoms such as
      wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time
      and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation.
    quote_location: Chapter 1, Definition, page 14
    explanation: >-
      This text explicitly defines asthma as a disease characterized by respiratory
      symptoms (wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, cough) and airflow
      limitation, directly supporting its classification as a respiratory system disorder.

    publication_title: Pathophysiology of Asthma
    quoted_text: >-
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways involving multiple
      cell types and cellular elements. The chronic inflammation is associated
      with airway hyperresponsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing,
      breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing.
    quote_location: Abstract
    explanation: >-
      The text describes asthma as a disorder of the airways with respiratory
      manifestations, confirming its classification under respiratory system disorders.

      Prompt: "Analyze the medical literature to determine whether asthma should be
      classified as a respiratory system disorder. Consider pathophysiology, clinical
      presentation, and standard medical classifications."

      Summary: Deep research analysis of 47 sources including medical textbooks,
      peer-reviewed articles, and clinical guidelines. Found unanimous consensus that
      asthma is primarily a respiratory condition characterized by airway inflammation,
      bronchospasm, and respiratory symptoms. All major classification systems (ICD-10,
      SNOMED CT, MeSH) place asthma under respiratory disorders. The analysis found no
      credible sources suggesting alternative classifications.
