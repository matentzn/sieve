      GWAS have identified over 900 genetic loci associated with body mass index
      and obesity-related traits, explaining approximately 6% of BMI variance.
    quote_location: Results, page 245
    explanation: >-
      While genetic factors contribute to obesity risk, the 6% variance explained
      suggests genetics is only one factor among many, providing weak support
      for classifying obesity as a genetic disease.

    quoted_text: >-
      The rapid rise in obesity prevalence over the past 50 years cannot be
      explained by genetic changes, which occur over much longer timescales.
      Environmental factors including food availability, physical activity
      patterns, and socioeconomic conditions are the primary drivers of the
      obesity epidemic.
    quote_location: Discussion, page 1342
    explanation: >-
      This strongly contradicts the genetic classification, noting that the
      rapid increase in obesity rates rules out genetics as the primary cause.

      Prompt: "Analyze whether obesity should be classified as a genetic disease
      based on current scientific evidence."

      Summary: Review of 156 sources indicates that while genetic factors
      contribute to obesity susceptibility, classifying obesity as a genetic
      disease is not supported by current evidence. Key findings:
      - Heritability estimates (40-70%) indicate significant non-genetic factors
      - Monogenic obesity forms exist but represent <5% of cases
      - Rapid prevalence increase incompatible with genetic causation
      - WHO, ICD, and major health organizations classify obesity as
        nutritional/metabolic, not genetic
      Recommendation: Reject genetic disease classification for general obesity.
